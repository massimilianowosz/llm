# Transformer Autoregressive Language Model

## Phases of Model Development

### 1. Pre-training Phase
- **Purpose**: Learn general language representations from a large, unlabeled corpus
- **Process**: 
  - Model learns basic linguistic patterns and knowledge
  - Uses unsupervised learning on raw text data
  - Builds foundational understanding of language structure

### 2. Instruction Fine-tuning Phase
- **Purpose**: Adapt the model to follow specific instructions and improve task performance
- **Process**:
  - Train on carefully curated instruction-based datasets
  - Teaches model to understand and execute precise user directives
  - Enhances model's ability to generate contextually appropriate responses
  - Improves zero-shot and few-shot learning capabilities

### 3. Inference Phase
- **Purpose**: Deploy the trained model to generate text or solve specific tasks
- **Process**:
  - Load pre-trained and fine-tuned model weights
  - Accept user prompts or input
  - Generate contextually relevant and instruction-aligned outputs

## Configuration Details

Customizable parameters in `config.py` allow fine-tuning of:
- Model architecture
- Training hyperparameters
- Dataset configurations
- Hardware optimization

## Usage

```bash
# Pre-training
